                <h3 class="bg-dark">Count Of Artois, Brother Of Louis XVI</h3>
                <br><br>
                <p align="justify">The Count of Artois and future Charles X was the third oldest brother of Louis XVI and the troublemaker of the royal family. In 1773 he married Maria Theresa of Savoy,then left France in July 1789 at the first signs of the Revolution, only returning in 1814. While abroad he re-joined his brother, Louis Stanislas Xavier, the Count of Provence, in 1791 and remained by his side before going back to France in 1814 under the title of Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom to prepare the former’s return as Louis XVIII.
<br><br>
He succeeded his brother to the French throne in turn after the former’s death in 1824, becoming Charles X and a strict upholder of the Catholic party. He was crowned in Reims the following year.
<br><br>
This spectacular but somewhat outmoded ceremony, fifty years after the coronation of Louis XVI, generated surprise among popular opinion and represented a backward step that was difficult to accept. Charles X was overthrown by the July Revolution in 1830, known as “Trois Glorieuses”, and left for exile to England, Scotland, Prague and finally Istria, where he died in 1836.
<br><br>
When he was young, the Count of Artois shared a large double apartment with his wife on the first floor of the South Wing. After becoming Charles X, he had no major plans for the Palace, which he simply maintained. When he left for Saint-Cloud during the revolution in 1830, in the early morning of 31st July, he avoided Versailles after warnings from the governor of the town made him fear the hostility of the population, stopping instead for a few hours in the Grand Trianon before travelling on to Rambouillet then taking the road to exile

                <h5 align="center" class="bg-dark">Old Chateau de Bagatella Park Of Paris</h5>
                <br>
                <p align="justify">In 1777, a party was thrown in the recently completed house in honour of Louis XVI and the Queen. The party featured a new table game featuring a small billiard-like table with raised edges and cue sticks, which players used to shoot ivory balls up an inclined playfield with fixed pins. The table game was dubbed "bagatelle" by the Count and shortly after swept through France, evolving into various forms which eventually culminated in the modern pinball machine.
<br>
The formal garden spaces surrounding the château, which was linked to its dependencies by tunnels, was expanded with a surrounding park in the naturalistic English landscape style by the Scottish garden-designer Thomas Blaikie, and dotted with sham ruins, an obelisk, a pagoda, primitive hermits' huts and grottoes.
<br>
A fête given on 20 May 1780, described in Blaikie's diary, gives a sense of the extravagant atmosphere. An additional part of the Bois de Boulogne had recently been taken into the prince's grounds, but the wall remained:
<br>
Mr Belanger had an invention which made a Singulare effect by undermining the wall on the outside and placing people with ropes to pull the wall down at a word.... there was an actor who acted the part of a Magician who asked their Majesties how they liked the Gardens and what a beautiful view there was towards the plain if that wall did not obstruct it but that their Majesties need only give the word that he with his enchanted wand would make that wall disappear; the Queen not knowing told him with a laugh 'Very well I should wish to see it disappear' and in the instant the signal was given and above 200 yards opposite where the company stood fell flat to the ground which surprised them all"
<br>
Following the Revolution, Napoleon I installed his son the Roi de Rome there, before the château was restored to the Bourbons. In 1835, it was sold by Henry, Count of Chambord to Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford and was inherited on his death seven years later by his son, the 4th Marquess, who already lived in Paris for most of the year. It contained the largest part of his extensive collection of French paintings, sculptures, furniture and works of decorative art, most of which went to form the Wallace Collection in London. Bagatelle underwent five years of redecorating and extensions, and then Lord Hertford did not reside in it until 1848.
<br>
Like most of his unentailed property, Bagatelle was left to his illegitimate son Sir Richard Wallace on Lord Hertford's death in 1870, as his entailed property and his title passed to a distant cousin. Bagatelle was acquired from his heir, Sir John Murray-Scott, by the City of Paris in 1905.
<br>

The Bagatelle gardens, created by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier, the Commissioner of Gardens for the city of Paris, are the site of the annual Concours international de roses nouvelles de Bagatelle, an international competition for new roses run by the City of Paris in June of each year. It was first organized in 1907, making it the oldest competition in the world dedicated to this flower.
<br>
Though the Revolutionary sales emptied the house, at Bagatelle in Sir John Murray-Scott's time were replicas of the bronze vases at Versailles. Upon the sale of the house by Sir John Murray-Scott, the vases were sent to his brother's house, Nether Swell Manor in Gloucestershire.
<br>
In 1892, the Bagatelle grounds hosted the first French championship match in rugby union, in which local side Racing Club de France, predecessor of today's Racing 92, defeated fellow Parisians Stade Français 4–3.The Bagatelle also played host to some of the polo events for the 1924 Summer Olympics in neighbouring Paris.

<br>
A number of the aviation experiments conducted by pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont used the grounds of Bagatelle (48°52′5″N 2°14′24″E), next to the château, as a flying field, most notably the initial flights of his 1906-era Santos-Dumont 14-bis canard biplane.</p>
